# Device Update Readiness Checker

**Device Update Readiness Checker** is an Android utility designed to help users determine whether their device is ready for system or application updates. By evaluating multiple device health metrics, it provides a readiness score, status, and actionable suggestions to ensure updates are performed safely, minimizing risks like crashes, overheating, or slow performance.

## Features

- **Battery Monitoring** – Assesses battery level, temperature, and overall health to prevent updates on low or overheating batteries.  
- **CPU & RAM Evaluation** – Monitors CPU load, temperature, and RAM usage to ensure device stability during updates.  
- **Storage Assessment** – Checks available storage and fragmentation to avoid update failures.  
- **Network Check** – Evaluates network stability and speed for reliable update downloads.  
- **Device Age Awareness** – Factors in device age to apply caution for older hardware.  
- **OS & App Health** – Detects outdated operating systems and frequent app crashes to prevent issues.  
- **Readiness Scoring** – Produces a numerical score (0–100) and categorizes as Safe, Warning, or Risky.  
- **Actionable Suggestions** – Provides clear recommendations to improve device readiness before updating.

## How It Works

The checker evaluates several device health factors:

1. **Battery** – Ensures sufficient charge and safe temperature.  
2. **CPU & RAM** – Prevents updates if the device is under heavy load.  
3. **Storage** – Warns if free space is low or storage is fragmented.  
4. **Network** – Advises against updating on unstable or slow networks.  
5. **Device Age** – Older devices may face performance issues, increasing caution.  
6. **OS & App Health** – Encourages backup and update preparation for devices with outdated systems or frequent app crashes.  

The final readiness score determines the update status:

- **Safe (80–100):** Device is ready for update.  
- **Warning (50–79):** Update is possible but caution is advised.  
- **Risky (<50):** Update may cause issues; follow suggested precautions.
